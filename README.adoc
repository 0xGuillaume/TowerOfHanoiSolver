The Tower of Hanoi is a puzzle based on **3 rods and** X **number of disks**. Your goal is to move the entire stack of the first tower (or rod) to the third. You must follow 3 rules :

- Only one disk may be moved at the time.

- Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.

- No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.

The minimal of moves required to solve the puzzle is obtain via **2^_n_ - 1** where **_n_** is the number of disks.
